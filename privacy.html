                    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 4, 2025</p>

                    <h2>Our Privacy Philosophy</h2>
                    <p>
                        At SnipKeys, your privacy isn't an afterthought—it's the foundation of our product. We created SnipKeys to be a powerful, personal tool that you can trust completely. Our commitment is simple: <strong>what you type is yours and yours alone</strong>. We have designed our app and keyboard from the ground up to collect the absolute minimum data required to function, and we will never track your keystrokes or the content you create.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
                    <p>We've divided this into two parts: the SnipKeys companion app and the SnipKeys Keyboard Extension.</p>

                    <h3>1. The SnipKeys Companion App</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> We collect none. You do not need an account to use SnipKeys. We do not ask for your name, email address, or any other personal identifiers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Your Snippets:</strong> All the snippets (text fragments) and key configurations you create are stored <strong>only on your device</strong>. If you have iCloud enabled, this data may be securely synced across your devices using Apple's iCloud service, which we cannot access.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>2. The SnipKeys Keyboard Extension</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Keystrokes:</strong> We <strong>do not</strong> collect, log, or transmit anything you type using the SnipKeys keyboard. The content of your snippets is inserted directly into the text field you are using and is never sent to us.</li>
                        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We do not collect any analytics or usage data from the keyboard extension itself.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>The "Allow Full Access" Permission</h2>
                    <p>
                        You may notice that some third-party keyboards ask for "Full Access" permission.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The core functionality of SnipKeys does NOT require "Full Access."</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We have intentionally designed it this way to give you the highest level of privacy and security. Without this permission, the keyboard operates in a strict sandbox, completely isolated from the network and other apps, which guarantees that we cannot access your keystrokes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the future, we may offer optional features (such as custom sounds or haptic feedback) that require this permission to function. If we do, enabling these features will be your choice, and we will clearly explain why the permission is needed at that time. Even with Full Access enabled for such features, our policy of not logging or transmitting your keystrokes will remain unchanged.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
                    <p>
                        Since we collect virtually no personal information, there is very little to use. Your snippets are used only by you to populate your keyboard. That's it.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
                    <p>
                        We do not sell, trade, rent, or share your personal data with any third parties because we don't have it in the first place.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Data Security</h2>
                    <p>
                        All your snippet data resides on your device, protected by the security measures of Apple's iOS. If you use iCloud sync, your data is protected by Apple's end-to-end encryption.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
                    <p>
                        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
                    </p>
